trac-multiproject-installer is mostly tested with VagrantUp. If you are
unfamiliar with VagrantUp, please see http://www.vagrantup.com/

--

Requirements:

a) Install Virtualbox, VirtualBox Extensions, VagrantUp for virtual environment
b) Have existing Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or newer installation

--

1) Copy provision.conf.sample to provision.conf and configure your
     installation. Include proxy settings, if necessary.

2) (Optional) Copy sql dump and trac backup to backup/ directory as
     "dump.sql", "trac.tar.gz" to auto-provision from backup.

3) Have network available. Packages will be downloaded and Trac
     components downloaded by source. To make testing with VagrantUp
     much faster, apt archives will be stored in "cache".

4a) $ vagrant up
4b) # ./provision.sh
4c) $Â sudo ./provision.sh

VagrantUp: Surf to https://yourserver.com:30443/home
Otherwise: https://yourserver.com:443/home

--

With VagrantUp, port mappings are in place. To change them, edit
  'Vagrantfile'.

1) http has host port 30080
2) https has host port 30443
3) ssh has host port 2222

--

Customize:

1) Feel free to hack the provision script itself
2) Put scripts to post-install/ dir, they will _sourced_ in, in
   alphabetical order at the end of the installation. See
   "50restore-backup.sh" for example.

Enjoy!
