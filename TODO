TODO:

* Chef/Puppet provision would be nicer and more widely usable.
* Multiproject commits at 16th Apr break installation, thus
  using commit just prior that. Check that out.
* Fix timeout's on some commands (pip especially) on slow networks.
* Allow caching of git/svn same as deb packages for easier debugging.
